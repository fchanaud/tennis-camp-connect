## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
cd tennis-camp-connect
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1. Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to SQL Editor and run the schema from `supabase-schema.sql`
3. Run the seed data from `seed-data.sql` to create initial admin and coach users
4. Get your project URL and anon key from Settings > API

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Update `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 👤 Default User Credentials

After running the seed data SQL, you'll have these default users:

**Admin Account:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin7k4m1` (example - will vary based on random generation)

**Coach Account:**
- Username: `coach`
- Password: `coach3x9p2` (example - will vary based on random generation)

**Note:** Actual passwords are generated with the pattern: `{username}{1 digit}{4 alphanumeric}`

## 🔐 Authentication System

### Username Generation
- Pattern: `{first_letter_of_firstname}{lastname}`
- Example: John Smith → `jsmith`

### Password Generation
- Pattern: `{username}{1 random digit}{4 random alphanumeric}`
- Example: `jsmith3a7k2`
- Passwords are shown only once during user creation
